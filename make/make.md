# MAKE Documentation notes

## Overview of make

The `make` utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be
recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.

You can use `make` with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command.

You can use it to describe any task where some files must be _updated automatically_ from others _whenever the others change_.

A file called `makefile` is required, it will describe relationships among the files of our programs while providing commands for updating each one of them.

Tipically, executable file are updated from object files, which are made by compiling source files.

The command `make` will use the makefile data and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.

## An Introduction to Makefiles

The makefile tells `make` how to compile and link a program.

Makefiles consists of `rules` like the following:

```makefile
target ... : prerequisites ...
    recipe
    ...
    ...
```

`target:` usually the name of a file generated by a program, executable or object files, even name of actions to carry out.

`prerequisite:` files used as input to create the target.

`recipe:` action that `make` carries out. May be more than one command.

_You need to put tabs at the beginning of every recipe line._

Usually a recipe is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a target file if any of the prerequisites change.

A `rule` that specifies a `recipe` does not need prerequisites.

`Rules` explain how and when to remake certain files which are the targets of a particular rule.

`Make` carries out the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update the target.

Makefiles may contain more text other than rules, but all it needs are rules.
